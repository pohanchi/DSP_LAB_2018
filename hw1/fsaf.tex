2. If the diameter of a network with 100 nodes is 2, what is the
minimum number of links in this network?
\end{flushleft}
\end{normalsize}
the two node maximum geodesic distance is $2$,which means its graph is a node in center and others surround it.so the minimum number of links is \\
\begin{center}
 $100-1=99$
 \end{center} 
\noindent

3. For a network of 100 nodes, if the degree of every node is at most
2, what is the minimum diameter of that network?
\end{normalsize}
\end{flushleft}
For example,if a network have 4 node with this degree limit,its diameter is 2.Another example is that,if a network have 5 node with this degree condition ,its diameter is 2.
Because of this limit,all node of the network would become a likely circle if the number of its node is increasily.
So,the answer is \\
\begin{center}
$100\div2=50$
\end{center}
\noindent

4. For a network of 100 nodes, if the degree of every node is at most
3, is it possible that the diameter of this network is not greater
than 5?
\end{normalsize}
\end{flushleft}
No,it is impossible.Because if a node have limit at most 3,it would like a binary tree. But if a binary tree have 4 layer,the most left side node and the most right side node have a distance is 6 which is larger than 5 ,and it only take 15 node. so it's impossible.
